## TECH-TEST WALKTHROUGH

Through this walkthrough of the tech test is my intention to show my logical process in order to obtain the solution asked.

1. GENERAL APPROACH.

My approach has been trying to implement the MVP, understood that as the minimum requirements to make the web-app works.

Once the MPV product has been implemented I have tryed to accomplish the task reffered as bonus points. 

It has been my intention to write the best code possible, however I have prioritise completing the task, the MVP, and once this has been completed and the different milestones achieved I have tried to organise the code.

I have used helper functions to refactor the code to make it more clearer and matein cleaner the main functions, in charge of the flow of the game.

2. Version Control Approach.

I have worked always in branches following a ticket approach. 
Each branch had been use for a particular function development, and until the function is not fully developed and tested I did not merge the branch in the main one.

I have tried to use, whenever possible, the red-green testing approach, which means create a commit every test is passed.

3. Testing Approach.

I have followed the RED - GREEN , TDD approach. Trying to fail the test, see what I need to develop to pass it and so on.

Whenever the test pass I have created a commit.

When a general milestone is acomplish, generally a function fully developed and tested I have merged the branch in which I was working and created a new one and so on until the end.
