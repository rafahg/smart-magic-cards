## TECH-TEST WALKTHROUGH

Through this walkthrough of the tech-test is my intention to show my logical process in order to obtain the solution asked.

1. GENERAL APPROACH.

My approach has been trying to implement the MVP, understood that as the minimum requirements to make the web-app works.

Once the MPV product has been implemented I have tried to accomplish the tasks assigned as bonus points. 

It has been my intention to write the best code possible, however, due to lack of skills or knowledge sometimes I have prioritised to obtain user functionality for the MVP, and once this has been completed and the different milestones achieved I have tried to organise the code.

I have used helper functions to refactor the code to make it clearer and maintain cleaner the main functions, in charge of the flow of the game.

2. VERSION CONTROL APPROACH.

I have worked always in branches following a ticket approach. 
Each branch had been used for particular function development, and until the function is not fully developed and tested I did not merge the branch in the main one.

I have tried to use, whenever possible, the red-green testing approach, which means create a commit every test is passed.

Only have been merged to the main branch those branches which have been fully tested and are functional at the same time.

I have added more functionalities in other branches, and the final version regarding functionality is in the devSpace-paragraphs branch, which has not been merged to the main branch due to several problems to be resolved.

3. TESTING APPROACH.

I have followed the RED - GREEN, TDD approach. Trying to fail the test, see what I need to develop to pass it and so on.

Whenever the test pass I have created a commit.

When a general milestone is accomplished, generally a function fully developed and tested, I have merged the branch in which I was working and created a new one and so on until the end.

4. PROBLEMS I HAVE FOUND.

 - Plan the code effectively to accomplish all the goal and make the product maintainable. I have found myself in "traps" created by me in previous steps. 
 - I have found cypress framework awesome to do frontend testing, I have used in the past but now I have a deeper knowledge of it. However, It has been really challenging to combine a new test with all test without breaking some previous test. Definitely, an area that I need to research and study more.

 5. THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE

  I would have had more time to do this challenge I would have done these implementations:

- Organising the code in a more effective way, in a more Object-oriented programming way. Creating different classes and trying to improve in single responsibility. That will help me to make the code easy to test and much more maintainable.
- Testing much more. I have implemented a few tests for the little implementations I have made but I have found difficult to integrate those test with the previous ones. So that's a topic I really would like to make better.
- Writing a more concise a cleaner code. I am aware that some of the functions I have written can be shorter, so I will work in to make the code more DRY.


6. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED.

- I have found a new respect for Front-end development. It is awesome to see things happen in the screen and the DOM manipulation is definitely something which a huge deal of knowledge to master.
- I have tried to organise the flow of the code in helper functions and main functions to make the code more mainteinable. With more time, as I have said, I will do it following a OOP approach.
- I have gone deeper in my knowledge about cypress. Many more to go.

- Mostly, that I have a lot to learn, and <strong>It would be a huge pleasure to be part of a team in SmartPensions to be able to become a better developer.</strong>
